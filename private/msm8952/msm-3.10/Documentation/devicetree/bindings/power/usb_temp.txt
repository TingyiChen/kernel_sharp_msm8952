To proetect the usb hardware by usb temperature

The hardware must be have a thermistor to monitor the temperature of usb side.
We can to enable/disable charging by HW with this temperature.

- qcom,open_mosfet_temp:		If the diff of (Tusb - Tbatt) is bigger
					than this value, it would be to disable
					charging.
- qcom,close_mosfet_temp:		If the diff of (Tusb - Tbatt) is less
					than this value, it would be to enable
					charging again.
- qcom,interval_switch_temp:	If the diff of (Tusb - Tbatt) is bigger
					than this value, it would be to set the
					the montor to fast check mode.

Example:
	usb_temp {
		compatible = "qcom,usb_temp_protect";
		pinctrl-names = "default";
		pinctrl-0 = <&usb_temp_default>;
		qcom,gpio_usb_temp_protect = <&msm_gpio 131 0x00>;
		qcom,open_mosfet_temp = <15>;
		qcom,close_mosfet_temp = <10>;
		qcom,interval_switch_temp = <7>;
		vdd-supply = <&pm8950_l16>;
		qcom,usb_temp-vadc = <&pm8950_vadc>;
		status = "okay";
	};
